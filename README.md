# Elliptic

This is a very basic implementation of Elliptic Curves in C++ inspired by Nantenaina Andrianaivo Louis (https://www.nantenaina.xyz/posts/basic-implementation-of-an-elliptic-curve-in-cpp/). 

This implementation can represent an EC in the Short-Weierstrass, Montgomery and Edward forms.

I plan to extend this to implement Weil/Tate pairing (maybe from Elliptic Nets https://eprint.iacr.org/2006/392.pdf) to facilitate the implementation of DVS schemes based on bilinear maps.



# Warning

This is by no means an efficient or secure implementation of Elliptic Curves, thus not suitable for ANY kind of cryptography (except maybe the recreational type, which is what I am planning to do).
